# Climate Fresk Debrief
This project is a debriefing slide deck for the Climate Fresk (aka Climate Collage). It runs in a modern browser and can be operated with arrow keys or spacebar. It is based on the framework [Flowtime.js](https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js/). 

The site is almost completely self contained and can therefore be run locally wihtout internet connection. Just open *climat.html*
